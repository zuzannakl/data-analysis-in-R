# Data Analysis in R

This repository contains data analysis projects created in R, focusing on statistical methods and real data analysis.

## Project Structure

### Time Series Analysis
Complete analysis and forecasting of time-dependent data.
* **White Noise Testing:** Graphical and formal statistical tests (Box-Pierce, Ljung-Box).
* **Decomposition:** Trend and seasonality removal using `STL`, `decompose`, and regression models.
* **Predictive Modeling:** Advanced forecasting using `AR(p)`, `(S)ARIMA`, and `ETS` (Exponential Smoothing).
* **Case Studies:** Global temperature anomalies (astsa) and economic indicators (euretail).

### Survival Analysis
Statistical modeling of time-to-event data with a focus on censored observations.
* **Nonparametric Estimation:** Kaplan-Meier and Fleming-Harrington estimators with tail corrections.
* **Parametric & Semiparametric Models:** AFT, Cox Proportional Hazards, and Proportional Odds models.
* **Clinical Applications:** Analysis of lung cancer datasets and clinical trial data for remission times.
* **Model Selection:** Variable selection using AIC, BIC, and FIC criteria.

### Financial Market Modeling
Implementation of selected financial mathematics and investment analysis problem.
* **Time Value of Money:** Present and future value calculations for uneven cash flows.
* **Interest Rate Conversions:** Nominal and effective interest rates equivalent at different coupon payment frequencies..
* **Investment Evaluation:** Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and cash flow analysis.
* **Financial Decision Analysis:** Comparison of credit offers using RRSO calculations.

## Notes
Reports and code were developed as part of university coursework and are written in **Polish**. For accessibility, the repository structure and this documentation are provided in English.
